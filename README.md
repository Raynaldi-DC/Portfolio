# 👋🏻 Halo!
Selamat Datang di Repository Saya.  
(Welcome to My Repository)

## 🗂️ Portfolio
This repository is a curated collection of my personal machine learning projects, designed to demonstrate my hands-on experience across various ML domains.

**Projects are categorized into four major areas:**  
### 🗣️ [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/Raynaldi-DC/Natural-Language-Processing)  
 - Text classification, sentiment analysis, extract data from text.  
 - Using method such as BERT, Regex, and Fuzzy Match.  
### 🧠 [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/Raynaldi-DC/Supervised-Learning)  
 - Classification and regression problems.  
 - Using models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression.  
### 📊 [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/Raynaldi-DC/Unsupervised-Learning)  
 - Clustering, segmentation, and anomaly detection.  
 - Using algorithms like KMeans, Mixture Model, and DBSCAN.  
### 📈 [Time Series](https://github.com/Raynaldi-DC/Time-Series)  
 - Forecasting and trend modeling.  
 - Using models such as LSTM, ARIMA, and Prophet.  

**_Each folder contains:_**  
-Clean, modular code in Python.  
-Notebooks for EDA and experimentation.  
-Result visualizations and evaluation metrics.  
-Explanatory README for each project.
