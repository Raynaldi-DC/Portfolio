# 👋🏻 Halo!
Selamat Datang di Repository Saya.  
(Welcome to My Repository)

## About This Repository
This repository is a curated collection of my personal machine learning projects, designed to demonstrate my hands-on experience across various ML domains.

**Projects are categorized into four major areas:**  
🧠 [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/Raynaldi-DC/Supervised-Learning)  
-Classification and regression problems.  
-Using models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression.  
📊 [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/Raynaldi-DC/Unsupervised-Learning)  
-Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.  
-Using algorithms like KMeans, PCA, and DBSCAN.  
📈 [Time Series](https://github.com/Raynaldi-DC/Time-Series)  
-Forecasting and trend modeling.  
-Using models such as LSTM, ARIMA, and Prophet.  
🗣️ [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/Raynaldi-DC/Natural-Language-Processing)  
-Text classification, sentiment analysis, and embedding techniques.  
-Using models such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and LSTM.  

**Each folder contains:**  
-Clean, modular code in Python.  
-Notebooks for EDA and experimentation.  
-Result visualizations and evaluation metrics.  
-Explanatory README for each project.
